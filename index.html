    <p>I am Nelson Baroi, a Bangladeshi born on August 1, 1995, currently residing at 5-22, AMT City,
       Char Shahpur, Ishwardi, Pabna, Bangladesh.</p>

      I thrive on diverse perspectives and believe in the power of collaboration to drive innovation.
      My values center around making a positive societal impact, and I approach life with a strategic, 
      critical thinking mindset.</p>
         
    <p>
     As the Country Director of <a href="https://atom-alliance.com/en/project/constuction/npp-rooppur/" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;">AMT Engineering JSC</a> , I lead the company's operations in Bangladesh, where we provide engineering support to Rooppur nuclear power plant. I am responsible for overseeing the human resources, business processes, procurement, and file systems of our local branch, ensuring efficiency, quality, and compliance. I also collaborate with our global partners and clients, facilitating communication and coordination across different regions and cultures.

I have a strong background in administration, management, and technology, which I acquired through my education and experience. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Informatics from <a href="https://kalmgu.ru/" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;">Kalmyk State University</a>, where I researched how to use computer technology to intensify business processes. I also completed multiple online courses on cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and web development, enhancing my digital skills and knowledge. Before becoming the Country Director, I worked as a Senior Administrator at AMT Engineering for over five years, managing various administrative tasks and projects, and improving our internal systems and procedures. I have demonstrated my change management skills by successfully implementing new software and policies, increasing our productivity and security.

I am passionate about engineering and innovation, and I strive to contribute to the development and advancement of the power sector in Bangladesh and beyond.
